    "As noted earlier during the raw data inspection, certain columns required data type conversions. The Sex and Embarked columns were originally stored as objects (strings) and were converted to categorical types. Since these columns contain a limited set of repeating values, converting them to categories improves memory efficiency and analytical performance. The Pclass column, initially an integer, was also converted to a categorical type because its values (1, 2, or 3) represent passenger classes rather than numeric quantities. Treating Pclass as a numeric variable could mislead machine learning models by implying ordinal relationships that do not reflect reality.\n",

    "The Survived column, although numeric, is a binary indicator (0 for deceased, 1 for survived). It is retained as an integer type to allow calculation of statistics such as the mean survival rate, which would not be straightforward if it were treated as a categorical variable."
